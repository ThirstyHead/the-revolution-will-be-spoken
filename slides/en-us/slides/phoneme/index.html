      For written English, we break things down into words and individual letters. For spoken language, we break things down into phonemes.       
            </p>

            <p>
For example, the words “sin” and “sing” end with two different sounds, or phonemes -- “n” and “ng”. Once you start digging into how words sound, you start finding some really fascinating relationships between letters that you might not have considered before.

Like the relationship between ‘p’ and ‘b’. ‘P’ is unvoiced -- only air passes between your lips. ‘B’ goes through the same motions of your lips, but it is voiced. The same relationship holds true for ‘s’ and ‘z’, ‘t’ and ‘d’, ‘f’ and ‘v’. Interesting, isn’t it, when you listen to the letters being spoken instead of reading them on the page.
