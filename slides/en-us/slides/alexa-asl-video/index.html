            I love this video, because it brings everything that weâ€™ve just learned together into a single, working example.
            <ul>

              <li>Once we can convert sign language into text, we can use text-to-speech to talk to Alexa.</li>
              <li>
Alexa hears our synthesized speech and sends it to the cloud for Speech-to-Text analysis. 
              </li>
              <li>
When the SSML response comes back from the cloud, Alexa uses text-to-speech to say it outloud.
              </li>
              <li>
Of course, we need to convert that synthesized speech back into text so that we can display it on screen for our deaf and hard-of-hearing users. 
              </li>
            </ul>
