            So, there are a few more lines of code for Speech Recognition than there are for Speech Synthesis, but it still all fits onto a single slide.

            We begin by creating a new instance of a SpeechRecognition object. Once the process is started, we'll get the written transcripts back in the "result" event. With a bit of simple "if/else" logic, we can have the browser read the appropriate section using the Speech Synthesis API that you already know.
