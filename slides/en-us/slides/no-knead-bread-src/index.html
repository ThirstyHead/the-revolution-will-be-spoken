           Notice that it really only takes us 2 lines of code to synthesize speech in a modern browser:

One line to create a new SpeechSynthesisUtterance, and another line to have the speechSynthesis API speak it.  
            </p>

            <p>
And more importantly, notice that we didnâ€™t have to download a library or framework to get this to work. The SpeechSynthesis API is baked into every modern browser.
