            So, now you’ve seen how easy it is to handle speech recognition in the browser (at least in browsers like Google Chrome whose development team has wired the client-side SpeechRecognition API to a corresponding cloud service). Here’s a real world example of how you can use Speech Recognition for Closed Captioning.

            <p>
In 180 lines of code (most of which is the HTML for the instructions), we’ve wired up Google’s browser-based Speech Recognition to Zoom’s Closed Captioning service. The next time you’re hosting a Zoom call, head over to LittlePath.org and turn on closed captioning. (Unfortunately, only the host of the Zoom call can turn on closed captioning.)
