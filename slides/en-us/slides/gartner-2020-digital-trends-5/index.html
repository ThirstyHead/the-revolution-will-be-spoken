            And trend number five is Inclusive Design. Now, Inclusive Design usually comes up when weâ€™re talking about folks with disabilities. But really, it means serving the broadest possible community of users. I like calling this Universal Design, because you and I end up using features that were originally created for folks with disabilities all the time. For example, how many of you have your phone in silent/vibrate mode? And how many of you are deaf or have a hearing loss? See what I mean?

            The explosion of Conversational UIs is simply an accessibility feature that has broken through to mainstream success. It was originally designed for folks with blindness or low vision, but how many of us use these features today?

            Look at those highlighted numbers for voice search usage. 50% of all internet searches in 2020 are voice-based. 40% of adults use voice search once a day. 9% of folks 55-64 do, too. And 55% of teenagers use voice search as well. A quarter of all Android searches are voice-based. See what I mean? Inclusive design. We need to build our apps not for some of the people, or even most of the people. We need to build our apps for ALL of the people.
