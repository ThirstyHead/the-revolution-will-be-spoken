            Here’s a great example of the power of SSML from Google’s documentation.

Notice the [say-as] element. That allows you to control how acronyms are spoken -- each letter spelled out, or pronounced as a word. It’d be strange to ask someone how much “R” “A” “M” they have in their new computer (instead of pronouncing it “RAM”). It’d also be odd to ask how fast their KAPOO is (instead of pronouncing it “C” “P” “U”).

Similarly, with numbers, you can have them spoken as cardinal numbers (1,2,3,4), ordinal numbers (first, second, third, fourth), and even spelled out -- because how weird would it be to tell someone that your phone number is “three hundred and three, five hundred and fifty-five, one thousand two hundred and twelve” instead of “303-555-1212”?
