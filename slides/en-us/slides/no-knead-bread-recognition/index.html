            Let's revisit our No Knead bread recipe. Last time, we used Speech Synthesis to read the introduction to us. This time, I'm going to click on the other button and see if Speech Recognition will work out for us.

            If the Great Demo Gods are smiling down on us right now, you should be able to say either "Ingredients" or "Instructions" and have that section read back to you.

            As we'll discuss in just a moment, this demo currently only works in Google Chrome. But it is a W3C standard, so hopefully sometime soon the other browsers will catch up with Google in this regard.
