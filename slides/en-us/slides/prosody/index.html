           Of course, we don’t call them emotions in linguistics -- that’d make your life far too easy. 

We call this phenomena “prosody” in linguistics. Things that aren’t typically represented in the written form -- intonation, stress, and rhythm. Prosody is what makes it so hard to figure out irony or sarcasm in texts and emails, but you can hear it clearly when listening to a speaker.
