      It's so easy to fall for this myth -- that the user experience is ONLY about visual design.

What other senses do your users use when they're visiting your website besides their eyes? Can they listen to your website? Can they talk to your website? Can they pinch and stretch with their fingers? Pull down to refresh and swipe right? Does your website buzz with haptic feedback?
            </p>
            <p>
There's a lot going on with your website -- far beyond what those little eyeballs can appreciate.
