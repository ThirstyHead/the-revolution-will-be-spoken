            As I just mentioned, Mozilla DeepSpeech is an impressive free and open source Speech Recognition engine. While it's not hosted, you can host it yourself and use it just like you'd use one of the other commercial services.

            <p>
            If you are concerned about privacy, or would like to deeply customize the Speech Recognition engine by training it exclusively on your voice and your speech patterns, Mozilla DeepSpeech is definitely worth looking into.
