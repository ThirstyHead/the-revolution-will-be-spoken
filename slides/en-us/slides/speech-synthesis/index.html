      Speech synthesis has been around for a long time -- like, almost 100 years (as we’ll see in just a moment).

But the mechanics of speech synthesis are pretty straight forward: for written English, we can take a string of text and split on the spaces to give us individual words. (This is called “tokenization”). Once we have words, we can look ‘em up in a dictionary that tells us precisely how they are supposed to be pronounced. And then we can synthesize the spoken word and pump it out to a speaker or a set of headphones.
